# Medical-Research-Agent
An AI-powered Medical Research Agent that turns complex medical text into clear insights. It extracts symptoms, causes and treatments and gives accurate medical definitions using RAG. 
The agent produces easy-to-understand and structured outputs for research use and for communication with patients.

# Features to be covered in this project:

Prompting (4+ different types)
Structured Output (Pydantic models)
Semantic Search (Tavily + Wikipedia)
RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation)
Tool Calling (Multiple APIs)
LangGraph (2 complex graphs, 8+ nodes, conditional edges)
